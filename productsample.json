It has a contrast ratio (the difference between the brightest a screen can be, and the darkest) of 1,000,000:1. It is also very sharp, with a resolution of 2436-by-1125. It is also able to change its color temperature using True Tone. According to Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of product marketing, the screens Apple used in the iPhone X were made to avoid the oversaturation of colors that are displayed on most OLED panels by adjusting color so that it doesn't look too saturated or very intense",
